# Real Analysis Notes (WORK IN PROGRESS)
This repository is home to an ongoing project that was first conceived during my time at Boston College. The goal of this project is for me to organize 4 semesters worth of real analysis notes into one document for my future self. The perfect time to make this a reality was while quarantined during the COVID-19 Pandemic. While these notes are mainly for my personal use, this repository is public. Online course notes are a great resource, and I see no harm in making these notes available to others (even though they may suck). That being said, apologies if these notes aren't helpful! I also am trying to be as pedantic as possible with proofs and examples.

# Sources I'm Using
One of the reasons I want to organize all my notes is because they pull from four different courses, and several texts. My goal is for the final product to be a convex combination of various sources, all presented in a approachable manner. 

1. "Baby" Rudin, *Principles of Mathematical Analysis* 
2. ("Adult"?) Rudin, *Real and Complex Analysis* 
3. ("Elderly"?) Rudin, *Functional Analysis*
4. Tao, *Analysis I*
5. Tao, *Analysis II*
6. Folland, *Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications*
7. Royden and Fitzpatrick, *Real Analysis*
8. Aliprantis, *Infinite Dimensional Analysis: A Hitchhiker's Guide*
9. Munkres, *Analysis on Manifolds*

# Tentative Outline
